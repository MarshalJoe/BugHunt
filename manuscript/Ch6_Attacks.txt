# Attacks

## XSS

Cross-site scripting, or XSS (the 'X' stands for cross) is one of the most common vulnerabilities found in websites today. There are a couple different flavors of XSS, but we're going to focus on [Embedded XSS](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Types_of_Cross-Site_Scripting#Stored_XSS_.28AKA_Persistent_or_Type_I.29) (so called because it entails *embedding* executable code in areas of a web application where other users will stumble across it). [Reflected XSS](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Types_of_Cross-Site_Scripting#Reflected_XSS_.28AKA_Non-Persistent_or_Type_II.29) is another common variation of XSS and operates on many of the same principles.

First-off, XSS is the real deal. [This guy](http://news.softpedia.com/news/Singapore-Hacker-Jailed-for-XSS-on-Prime-Minister-s-Office-Website-466921.shtml) went to jail for it, albeit in a place not-so-affectionately known as "[Disneyland with the Death penalty](http://archive.wired.com/wired/archive/1.04/gibson.html)". Google will [pay you a cool $3,133.7](http://www.google.com/about/appsecurity/reward-program/) for discovering the bug on a Google site. And to top it all off XSS is, according to [the 2014 Cenzic vulnerability survey](http://www.cenzic.com/downloads/Cenzic_Vulnerability_Report_2014.pdf), the most common vulnerability found in web applications today, discovered in a quarter of all the sites surveyed for the study.

Now because we want to demonstrate this vulnerability in a way that won't incur legal liability for advertising a live exploit, and, also importantly, that will allow you to reproduce it on your own, we're going to use a deliberately vulnerable teaching web app called Google Gruyere.

Before we set up Google Gruyere and began working through our XSS attack though, it's important to first understand an important security safeguard of the modern web &mdash; the very same safeguard we're going to subvert, actually: **The same-origin policy**.

### The Same-Origin Policy

All modern browsers implement some version of the same-origin policy, which is as straightforward as its name implies: Only scripts from pages on the same site may access that site's [DOM](http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Core/introduction.html) (Document Object Model, a nested, traversible map of a page's HTML elements). The reasoning is also direct: without some version of a same-origin policy, buttons on different sites could affect HTTP requests and DOM changes on other sites, permitting all sorts of malicious behavior.

### Exceptions

But there are exceptions to this rule, as there are to so many. Without it, [Google Fonts](https://www.google.com/fonts), Javascript libraries (e.g. [jQuery](http://jquery.com/), [Mootools](http://mootools.net/), etc.), and other [CDN]()-served static content wouldn't work:

````<link rel="stylesheet" href="http://site.com/style.css"/>````  
````<script src="https://site.com/script.js"></script>````

Because (using `<script>` as our example) the javascript file being included on the the HTML page with the `<script>` tag must be pulled from the `src`, *then executed*, that means an exception must be made to the same-origin policy to allow for that code (from another site, remember!) to run.

But by allowing `<link>` and `<script>` to bypass the typical conventions of the same-origin policy, serving up content from [CDNs](http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/C/CDN.html) (Content Delivery Networks) to execute on your page, a hole is opened up. A tiny hole, really, but &mdash; like all holes on the internet &mdash; big enough.

That exception makes it possible to execute valid javascript code within those and *other* HTML elements' attributes. The fact that running code in attributes is not limited to `<script>` and `<link>` is a key point. It's also useful to keep in mind that any javascript included executes within the context of the visiting user's browser environment. More about this later. 

Before we get to the actual code, let's take a look at our testing environment.

### Testing with Google Gruyere

[Google Gruyere](http://google-gruyere.appspot.com/) is a wonderful teaching tool and something every infosec hobbyist and early-career web security professional should have on their list of resources. It's a generator that creates sandboxed, live sites with deliberately-introduced vulnerabilities, meant to be exploited in a consequence-free environment, where the software's isolation (and lack of useful data) make it a safe target. The app itself is modeled after a basic social network skeleton, where users with profiles post "snippets" for public consumption.

![Google Gruyere Main Page](images/GG_about.png)

Although the [instructions for setting up your live sandbox](http://google-gruyere.appspot.com/part1) are readily available on the Google Gruyere website, they're simple enough to be easily summarized here:

1. Go to http://google-gruyere.appspot.com/start
- That's it!

Navigating to that address generates the sandboxed app you can mess around with to your heart's content.

![Google Gruyere App Homepage](images/GG_home.png)

Since the vulnerability we're interested in exploiting relies on posting unsanitized code where it can be executed (unwittingly) by other users, let's go ahead and create an account so that we can create snippets. We'll cover sanitizing code and user-to-user attacks in more detail in a bit.

This is what my screen looks like after logging in with the super-semantic username "SomeGuy."

![Google Gruyere Login](images/GG_login.png)

Next click on the "New Snippet" link, located in the header, which should bring you to this page.

![Google Gruyere New Snippet](images/GG_newSnippet.png)

Aha! There's an important clue here to a possibly fruitful approach. Specifically, the "*Limited HTML is now supported...*" part. But first some greater detail on code sanitation and how it applies to user data.

### Data Sanitation

Those users! Just when you think you can count on them to stick to kitten videos and real estate pyramid scams, they submit code that drops your email registry! The problem of input variability &mdash; the idea that anything open to the public web can and will be subjected to all manner of nasty stuffs &mdash; is a fundamental one in web application security. In order to cope with the reality of malicious user input, developers have created a number of different strategies for retaining the meat of valid posts, while stripping away elements (like escape characters for certain languages) that can prove harmful to either the application or its userbase.

Let's talk about two of the most common methods for sanitizing data (before swinging back to our Google Gruyere XSS attack).

**[Blacklisting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blacklist_%28computing%29)** is the process of creating and keeping up-to-date a list of all the sites, scripts, or elements that **are not** allowed to perform a particular action or access certain information on a given site.

**[Whitelisting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitelist)** is the process of creating/keeping current a list of all the sites, scripts, or elements that **are** allowed to perform an action or access information on a site.

Of the two, whitelisting is considered the better security strategy because blacklisting can be so easily circumvented by rejiggering names and other relevant identity markers. With that in mind, let's get to the actual code!

### Code

So how does all this sanitation talk apply to the "New Snippet" form we've opened in our instance of Google Gruyere? Here's the relevant page for a refresher:

![Google Gruyere New Snippet](images/GG_newSnippet.png)

As singled out before, the "*Limited HTML...*" language implies that there is some sanitation going on &mdash; Gruyere is allowing certain HTML markup elements meant to make the text/snippet more readable, but disallowing other ones (I'm looking at you `<script>`). Hence the word "limited." It's unclear whether they're whitelisting or blacklisting, at this point, since the strategies are just inversions of one another.

If you're asking yourself "What HTML elements or tags could be dangerous? If everything was allowed, what's the worst that could happen?" we'll cover that in a little bit, under the **Effects** section. For now, just recognize that being able to embed executable javascript is bad for the site (but a vulnerability for us!)

So let's test the waters a bit. The submission form says "*Limited HTML*," but that could just be a smokescreen,  meant to discourage shenanigans, right? Pretty sneaky, Google Gruyere! Let's start out with the slowest possible pitch:  `<script type="text/javascript">alert('hey!')</script>`

In this case, `alert('hey!')` is a simple canary for testing the browser coalmine: If the alert appears, then the javascript is being executed &mdash; and a whole lot of hijinks are possible.

If we submit that code as a snippet, we get redirected to the following page on Google Gruyere.

![Google Gruyere Initial Submit](images/GG_initialSubmit.png)

No luck! Our alert didn't activiate on submission and (absent any other trigger) will remain inert, harmless text. This was, admittedly, doomed from the start. `<script>` tags are almost always scrubbed from any content because of their clear utility for malicious purposes.

This is where everything about javascript code in certain HTML elements being executable comes into play. `<script>` tags, as stated before, are almost always stripped from any content. But what about code lurking in the `href` or `src` attribute of more innocuous markup?

Let's try another tag. One that might more easily slip past whatever basic sanitation mechanisms Google Gruyere has in place.

Opening another "New Snippet" submission form, enter the following code:

`<a onmouseover="alert('hey!')" href="#">read this!</a>`

`onmouseover` is a typical XSS go-to because it so often slips past sanitation censors. Let's see if it meets with any success here.

Once you've submitted that snippet and been redirected to the main index, mouse over your most recent post. You should see...

![Google Gruyere Success](images/GG_success.png)

Success! Success is most definitely what you should see.

You've now embedded code that can be remotely executed by other users visiting the site and mousing over that particular snippet. That's a vulnerability just waiting to be exploited and a definite headache in the making for whatever webmaster or sysadmin lies on the other side of all those [tubes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Series_of_tubes).

### Effects

So what's the earth-shattering consequence of being able to create an alert on someone else's window (or execute a snippet of javascript code, as an alert indicates is possible)? It seems annoying but still trivial, on the surface.

Before we discuss it in depth, let's make a quick, (hopefully) illustrative change to the code we just submitted as a snippet. Go ahead and submit the following code as a new snippet.

`<a onmouseover="alert(document.cookie)" href="#">read this too!</a>`

Mousing over this third entry, "read this too!" you should see something like the following:

![Google Gruyere Cookie Alert](images/GG_cookies.png)

This will soon sound all sorts of alarm bells, if it doesn't already. It all comes back to the function cookies serve on the modern web.

Cookies are how websites identify when it's *you* that's returned to that site, as opposed to any of the other thousands &mdash; or millions &mdash; of other individuals bombarding the server with HTTP requests at that moment. Since HTTP is [stateless](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stateless_protocol) and HTTP requests don't have the ability to access outside information about your identity and security privileges, all that information must be contained *inside each HTTP request*, to be communicated *each time you hit the server*. Cookies are numeric hashes (or in some rare, terrible cases) plaintext variales used by your browser to store that information and communicate it to the server &mdash; allowing you to sign in without logging in, because you've already been authenticated by your cookie.

Are the alarm bells ringing? If cookies authenticate an individual, then if someone else steals that cookie, they can impersonate the person it's tied to &mdash; accessing their account, payment information, and other sensitive details without having to know their username or password!

Since the code `alert(document.cookie)` that we've inserted as a snippet into Google Gruyere is always executed within the context of each individual accessing user's browser environment, it will `alert()` that user's own particular cookie set. All it would take to weaponize this exploit would be to include code initiating an HTTP POST request to the server of your choice with the cookie included along in the parameters. As discussed before, once you have their cookie, you can access someone's account as if you're them. For Google Gruyere, that's not a big deal. For a critical ecommerce platform like Amazon or Ebay... maybe so.

Unfortunately (or perhaps, fortunately), I'll forego covering that code, the last-criminal-mile in setting up a malicious XSS exploit. The more **important point** is that you now know enough to identify XSS bugs in the wild.

### Delivering XSS Payloads with Burp Intruder

Previously, I showed you how to detect XSS vulnerabilities the good 'old fashioned way &mdash; by directly submitting a series of increasingly obfuscated variations of the `alert(0)` classic.

That's a somewhat primitive approach and one that doesn't scale well: Large social networks, for example, have a vast array of input fields that make them impractical to test by hand. Sanitation filters can also be pretty idiosyncratic, and in order to exhaust the large number of possibilities (different tags, attributes, encodings, etc) that exist, it's necessary to at least partially automate the process.

I say *partially* because this isn't a scanner-type operation where you can enter a URL and let loose. Burp Intruder (which is available in the free version of the product) requires a little more tact. As a tool that requires more explicit enumeration of the payloads involved you could it even say it represents a more elegant tool, from a more sophisticated age...

Back to Burp: Intruder allows you to automate the act of feeding different payloads into multiple, specificed inputs. You can even specify the manner in which the payloads are submitted. But first, a definition of Intruder from Portswigger's own site. There's some marketing fluff, but if you skip to the good stuff, you'll see:

>A typical workflow using Burp Intruder is as follows:
> 
>* Identify an interesting or vulnerable request within any of the Burp Suite tools, and send this to Intruder.
>* Mark the locations in the request where you want to insert payloads.
>* Configure your attack payloads, using Intruder's highly configurable algorithms and preset lists, or your own custom list of payloads.
>* Start the attack and review the detailed results, including all requests made and responses received.
>* Analyze the results to achieve your chosen objective, using customizable filtering and sorting, or by defining your own rules for matching or extracting response data

This is a pretty accurate roadmap for the subject of this tutorial. Burp Intruder is an excellent (and again, free) tool that should be in the arsenal of every pentester.

### Installation

The first step in using Burp Intruder is [downloading Burp Suite](http://portswigger.net/burp/download.html). Since Burp is a java app, it's compatible with any OS that can run java (so, all of them). After you've downloaded and started up Burp Suite, follow these [browser-specific instructions](http://portswigger.net/burp/help/suite_gettingstarted.html) on how to configure your browser to run through the Burp proxy.

### Google Gruyere

Before opening Burp (or after, if you turn the intercept tab to "off"), go to everybody's favorite neighborhood deliberately-vulnerable web app, [Google Gruyere](http://google-gruyere.appspot.com/).

![Google Gruyere info](images/GG_about.png)

If you've gone through the previous exercise, feel free to use the same app instance, although clearing it is fine too.

Log in and you should see this page.

![Google Gruyere login](images/GG_login.png)

Click on the "New Snippet" link.

![Google Gruyere new snippet](images/GG_newSnippet.png)

Enter something that you'll be able to recognize in code &mdash; not "ref=" or something else willfully unsemantic. I've chosen `COOLSTUFF` because I routinely shout nonsense.

![Google Gruyere Cool Stuff](images/GG_coolstuff.png)

### Starting the Attack

Now comes the fun part! Open up Burp and go through the necessary steps to configure your browser (or if you've already done all that and your Intercept tab is set to "off" turn it to "on").

After you've turned the Intercept function of your Burp Proxy app on, go ahead and submit the "New Snippet" Form. It should hang...

...and hang. The Burp Proxy has intercepted the request and won't forward that HTTP traffic until you tell it to. For now, switching back to the Burp window, you should see this in your proxy tab:

![GG Burp Intercept](images/GG_intercept.png)

Now select the action tab...

![GG Burp Proxy Action](images/GG_action.png)

And the "Send to Intruder" option. Navigate over to the Intruder tab and you should see something like this. The highlighted areas are fields where Burp will insert the payloads you specify later.

![GG Burp Intruder](images/GG_intruderInitial.png)

For now, go ahead and click the "clear" button on the right hand side of the window. Then add brackets so that they encapsulate `COOLSTUFF` like so. The "New Snippet" content field is the only input surface we're interested in testing:

![GG Burp Intruder Select](images/GG_intruderSelect.png)

Great! Now switch over to the "payloads" tab. Go to the second field option ("Payload Options [Simple List]"). And add [this](https://code.google.com/p/fuzzdb/source/browse/trunk/attack-payloads/xss/xss-rsnake.txt?r=186), a `.txt` file of common XSS payloads taken from rsnake (all credit and praise to him). Afterwards your screen should look like this. Go ahead and uncheck the box to encode your payload for HTTP submission.

![GG Burp load payload](images/GG_loadPayload.png)

One more step! Go to the Intruder tab at the tob of Burp and select the first option "start attack." You'll get some text about how the free version of Burp suite is throttled, etc, etc. Click 'yes.' The window that pops up will contain the results of your attack.

### Interpreting the Results

Something along these lines should pop up in your attack window.

![GG Burp attack results](images/GG_attackResults.png)

There are several ways we can interpret the results and discern XSS hits and misses.

The first (and most direct) is noting the baseline request's time and how much, if at all, the times of subsequent payloads stray from it. The extended length of the request &mdash; in this instance almost three times the length of the baseline &mdash; definitely means those scripts are suspicious and worth confirming manually.

Another clue that the requests coming in way past the baseline are suspect, albeit one peculiar to this application, is that one of the first submission's in rsnake's list is a plain `<script>` tag that happens to return a plain 'ol, saintly `540` as the request time, the same as the baseline &mdash; as we discovered in our [last post](http://bughunting.guide/a-gentle-introduction-to-cross-site-scripting-xss/).

Another option is using XSS Validator, A Burp Suite extension available to both free and premium users that uses a Phantomjs server to send cross-site requests confirming legitimate vulnerabilities &mdash; and disproving false positives.


## CSRF

CSRF stands for **C**ross **S**ite **R**equest **F**orgery, and there's a reason that it's second in our list of web application vulnerabilities. CSRF can exist both independently and, in particularly nasty versions, in conjunction with XSS.

CRSF, in a nutshell, is when an attacker tricks a victim into executing a malicious request that &mdash; because it originates from the victim's computer, with his or her cookies and authentication credentials &mdash; is accepted by the authenticating server as a valid one.

Let's illustrate this with an example aimed at a textbook target for hackers everywhere: banks.

Say that a blackhat manages to insert a stored XSS script into some public area of a banking application. In a real attack, the blackhat could get this link to the victim any number of ways (spear phishing and other social engineering attacks, for example), but the important part is that the target of the attack clicking on the link has to do so while they're engaged with the bank server. Embedding XSS to initiate the proper request *can* be an effective strategy because it's a safe bet that the user will have the bank session cookies on their computer if they're baking online at that moment.

Back to the stored XSS. What would it look like? Probably look something like this:

`<SCRIPT SRC=http://bank.com/transfer.do?acct=SUSIE&amount=100000></SCRIPT>`

In this case, what's really getting executed at the browser level whenever the targeted user navigates to the page where this code lives is:

`GET http://bank.com/transfer.do?acct=SUSIE&amount=100000`

Note: The value of the `acct` variable has to match up with the person clicking the link.

It's pretty clear what the request is trying to accomplish &mdash; transferring money out of Susie's bank account that she most certainly **does not** want transferred. Attackers will oftentimes develop snippets like this from valid requests captured earlier in a session, just tweaking a few variables and turning an `amount=100` into an `amount=100000`.

Requests like this are accepted when the authenticating server doesn't have page or step-specific (in the case of online shopping carts) cookies that ensure you're not susceptible to spoofed requests after you've logged in that are made to look like they're coming from your own account.

These sorts of malicious requests are almost always directed at changing some sort of state as opposed to querying information, because any information accessed will be returned to the *target* and not the attacker. Money changing hands is probably the most common state change effected.

When checking any web application for CSRF vulnerabilities, it's important to check the web site to see if form requests include some version of a `csrf_token`. These tokens are generated in such a way that they cannot be predicted before hand and indicate unique requests by the validated client browser.


## SQL Injection (SQLi)

SQL stands for **S**tructured **Q**uery **L**anguage and is a programming language used to retrieve and store information from relational databases. Wars have been fought over whether the language is pronounced ESS-QUEbobbob SQL injection (SQLi) is when someone using a web app submits a SQL escape character or script snippet into an input field that is not properly sanitized before being stored in the app's SQL database.

Randall Munroe, author of the webcomic [xkcd](http://xkcd.com), probably described it best with this strip:

![xkcd comic](images/xkcd.png) 

Even though they're relatively simple errors to detect and solve, SQL injection vulnerabilities are still very prevalent in the general population of web applications, although their frequency is decreasing. But SSQL, the cornerstone of the workhorse LAMP hosting environment (**L**inux **A**pache **M**ySQL **P**HP) is still very common, making the number of applications susceptible to this vulnerability a wide swathe of the Internet.

### Testing for SQLi with SQLmap

The first thing you need to do to test SQLi with SQLmap is *get* SQLmap. The easiest way to install this and all packages (if you're on OS X) is [homebrew](http://brew.sh/) &mdash; a package manage similar to Linux's fantastic `apt-get`. If you're on windows, check out [chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/), a similar project. Although also &mdash; get off windows.

Once you have homebrew, you can install sqlmap with the simple command:
`brew install sqlmap`

To see the options available to you, enter `sqlmap -h`.

Whoa! That's a lot of information! Thankfully, actually using SQLmap to just detect a SQLi vulnerability isn't that complex. In fact, it takes just one command per instance of form submission.

Let's say your on a website you suspect uses SQL to store the user registry it employs for authentication. You, as a cunning researcher, want to check directly whether that authentication form is susceptible to SQLi aimed at dropping the user registry, escalating user privileges, or otherwise making hash of the website's current security clearance system. If the form you're testing is submitted over a GET request &mdash; that's terrible practice for an authentication system, but common for other input scenarios where SQLi might still be a possibility (why we're covering it) &mdash; then you would employ this sqlmap command:

`sqlmap -u "http://www.site.com/path/to/target.php?user=me&pass=somepass"`

Where the URL is the target of the GET request initiated by the form you're submitting. Note that it doesn't matter what you enter as the values for the input fields you're checking (the `me` and `somepass` parts). If the form is being passed to the server through a POST request (a much more common occurrence), then the command is still startingly simple, requiring only a slight alteration &mdash; the `--data` flag:

`sqlmap --data "user=me&pass=somepass" -u "http://www.site.com/path/to/target.php?"` 

If the sqlmap tools detects a SQLi vulnerability, text will appear confirming the find and prompting further 'takeover' options. Remember not to cause damage to the database of the web application you're testing! Most companies include language in their bug bounty policies placing any legal or financial liability for such damage squarely on the shoulders of the security researcher in question.
