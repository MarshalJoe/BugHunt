## CSRF

CSRF stands for **C**ross **S**ite **R**equest **F**orgery, and there's a reason that it's second in our list of web application vulnerabilities. CSRF can exist both independently and, in particularly nasty versions, in conjunction with XSS.

CRSF, in a nutshell, is when an attacker tricks a victim into executing a malicious request that &mdash; because it originates from the victim's computer, with his or her cookies and authentication credentials &mdash; is accepted by the authenticating server as a valid one.

Let's illustrate this with an example aimed at a textbook target for hackers everywhere: banks.

Say that a blackhat manages to insert a stored XSS script into some public area of a banking application. In a real attack, the blackhat could get this link to the victim any number of ways (spear phishing and other social engineering attacks, for example), but the important part is that the target of the attack clicking on the link has to do so while they're engaged with the bank server. Embedding XSS to initiate the proper request *can* be an effective strategy because it's a safe bet that the user will have the bank session cookies on their computer if they're baking online at that moment.

Back to the stored XSS. What would it look like? Probably look something like this:

`<SCRIPT SRC=http://bank.com/transfer.do?acct=SUSIE&amount=100000></SCRIPT>`

In this case, what's really getting executed at the browser level whenever the targeted user navigates to the page where this code lives is:

`GET http://bank.com/transfer.do?acct=SUSIE&amount=100000`

Note: The value of the `acct` variable has to match up with the person clicking the link.

It's pretty clear what the request is trying to accomplish &mdash; transferring money out of Susie's bank account that she most certainly **does not** want transferred. Attackers will oftentimes develop snippets like this from valid requests captured earlier in a session, just tweaking a few variables and turning an `amount=100` into an `amount=100000`.

Requests like this are accepted when the authenticating server doesn't have page or step-specific (in the case of online shopping carts) cookies that ensure you're not susceptible to spoofed requests after you've logged in that are made to look like they're coming from your own account.

These sorts of malicious requests are almost always directed at changing some sort of state as opposed to querying information, because any information accessed will be returned to the *target* and not the attacker. Money changing hands is probably the most common state change effected.
