# Conclusion

I hope this guide has sparked a larger interest for you in pentesting and given you the tools you need to continue your studies. This book will keep evolving and growing as I learn (from you!) what examples illustrate the target concepts most clearly and what topics in web application security are the most pertinent for beginners. I also intend to increase the number of attacks covered, provide extra walkthroughs of certain attacks using different tools, and provide more code samples that you can use as part of Burp Suite or other pentesting programs.

As such, I'd love to hear from you. If you have any ideas, suggestions, corrections, or revisions (or you just want to say hi!) reach out to suggestions@bughunting.guide
